# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
# DOM Manipulation Exercise

## Project Description
This project involves manipulating the DOM to achieve several interactive features:
- Build new section by JS create element method.
- Dynamically building navigation links.
- Add functionality to distinguish the section in view
- Highlighting sections in the viewport as the user scrolls.
- Collapsing sections to hide and show content.
- Displaying a scroll-to-top button when the user scrolls down the page.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. The page will display sections that can be navigated via the dynamically generated navigation bar.
3. As you scroll, the current section in view will be highlighted, and the navigation links will reflect this.
4. You can collapse or expand the sections by clicking on the "Collapse" button next to each section.
5. A "scroll-to-top" button will appear when you scroll down and can be clicked to quickly return to the top of the page.
